# My Doc of Thoughts

## What?

This is the place where I keep the purpose and the learning of some of the projects that I work on. It's purely out of hobby and maybe a lot of things are just building from scratch or implimentation of complex concepts to get a better practical view of any system.

## Why?

The primary reason for this small public-facing portfolio is to keep myself on-track of the things I'm doing and working upon. If there's a big gap between the things I was working with, I lose the context and the enthusiasm to work more on it, leading to unfinished projects and un-answered curiosity (a waste of time and effort!)

This will help me feel accountable of the work and projects that I'm working on, a way to keep track of things I have worked and learned and last but not the least, it will look good! :D

## About Me

I'm Harshit Vishwakarma, a Software Engineer. I like exploring things from the ground-up, this keeps me from taking things for granted and appriciate the beauty and complexity of the underlying systems that we all are working on. I want to break all the layers of abstractions of Algorithms and Systems that are impacting lives of billion people.
